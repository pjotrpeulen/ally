    <p> Once there was boy who traveled to the United States of America. He went from East to West, from South to North,
      and
      all the way back. There was a girl not small but average. She went with this boy to drive around the coast and
      Canada,
      hoping she would make it home. Home they came, in <strong>Biloxi, Mississippi</strong>.</p>
